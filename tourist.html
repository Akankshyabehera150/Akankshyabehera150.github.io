<h2>Maa Manikeswari temple</h2>

<p>
    The deity of Chakrakotamandala comprising present days Kalahandi,
     Koraput and Bastar was Manikya debi or Manikeswari around 10th century A.D. Later on Kalahandi king Harichandra Deo struggled and 
     died because of which his pregnant queen left for her father’s house in Gadapur, Phulbani. Some part of Phulbani was part of Mahakantara in ancient time and
      Chakrakota Mandala. Though capital of Chakrakotamandala is still being debated, it is clear that it has many similar with Kamala Mandala,
       another ancient name of Kalahandi, Manikya Devi came to Gadapur perhaps due to influence of Chakrakota Mandala. Later,
       the queen and her son, Ramchandra Deo returned with Manikya Debi or Manikeswari as per Kalahandi’s public request that time. 
       Manikeswari was brought from Gadapur (Phulbani) around 1200 A.D. and it was located in Kalahandi.

<h2>Rabandarh</h2>

<p>
    Rabandarh is a place of great scenic beauty lying about 12.8 K.Ms from Bhawanipatna and approachable by a dusty road.
     It is named after a small water fall inside a mountain gorge. The panorama around provides some delightful consrasts of 
     scenery, in mountains and over looking dales, in bore rocks and thick forests and in the eternal calmness of the surroundings
      broken by the music of the fall. Despite bad communications picnic parties some times visit the place from Bhawanipatna as
       there is no market nearby. The stream which creats the fall almost dries up during the hot season. Down stream, a Minor
        Irrigation Project utilizes its water for agriculture purposes.
